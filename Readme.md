This project is a full-stack trading platform consisting of separate backend and frontend applications, along with a dashboard for user interaction and analytics.

Backend (backend): Built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (via Mongoose), the backend handles authentication, user data, orders, holdings, and positions. It exposes RESTful APIs for the frontend and dashboard to interact with trading data securely.
Frontend (frontend): A React-based client application providing a modern, responsive user interface for users to interact with the trading platform. It includes landing pages, product showcases, and integrates with the backend APIs for real-time data and trading actions.

Dashboard (dashboard): Another React application focused on analytics, reporting, and visualization of user trades, holdings, and market indices. It offers advanced charts, watchlists, and a customizable user experience.

The project uses modern web technologies, supports modular development, and is structured for scalability and maintainability. Each part can be developed and deployed independently.
